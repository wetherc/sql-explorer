WIP: Fix failing frontend tests

This commit contains work-in-progress on fixing the failing frontend unit tests.

TODOs for resuming work:
- Investigate and fix DbExplorer.spec.ts failures (Tree stub rendering issues, empty DOMWrapper).
- Continue fixing QueryView.spec.ts failures (DataTable, Message, TabPanel stubs not found, MonacoEditor lang prop not reactive).
- Apply similar fixes to QueryTabs.spec.ts.
- Ensure all PrimeVue components are correctly stubbed or mocked in tests.
- Verify Pinia store reactivity in test environments.
- Run all frontend tests and ensure they pass.
