fix(backend): Align explorer commands with frontend parameters

Updated backend commands and driver implementations to correctly handle database and schema parameters for explorer functions, resolving inconsistencies with the frontend calls.

- Modified `DatabaseDriver` trait's `list_schemas` to accept a `database` parameter.
- Updated `mssql.rs`, `mysql.rs`, and `postgres.rs` implementations to conform to the new trait signature for `list_schemas`. For drivers where a database-specific schema list isn't directly supported by the underlying client, the parameter is marked as unused to maintain API consistency.
- Corrected `mssql.rs` `list_tables` and `list_columns` to properly stream and process results, fixing previous empty returns.
- Updated `commands.rs` to pass the `database` parameter to the `client.list_schemas()` call.
- Cleared `frontend/src/style.css` as it's redundant with Vuetify's styling.
