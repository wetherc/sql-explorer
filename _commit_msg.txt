fix(frontend): Resolve build failures and align Tauri versions

Fixed a series of critical build and configuration errors that prevented the frontend from compiling and running. The root cause was a version mismatch between the Tauri backend (v1.5) and the frontend's `@tauri-apps/api` dependency (v2).

Key fixes include:
- **Tauri API Version**: Replaced `@tauri-apps/api@^2.10.1` with the correct `^1.5.3` version to match the Tauri v1.5 backend.
- **TypeScript Configuration**:
  - Correctly configured `tsconfig.app.json` with path aliases and base URL.
  - Created an `env.d.ts` file to manage triple-slash type references for Vite, Vuetify, and Tauri, which resolved module resolution errors for `vue-tsc`.
  - Refactored the `DbType` enum to a `const` object to comply with modern TypeScript's `erasableSyntaxOnly` rule.
- **Vite Configuration**: Updated `vite.config.ts` with the correct dev server port and Tauri-specific settings.
- **Tauri Configuration**: Corrected the `beforeDevCommand` and `devPath` in `tauri.conf.json` to point to the correct frontend project and port.
- **Code Fixes**: Addressed all resulting TypeScript errors, such as implicit `any` types and potential `undefined` objects, across various stores and components.
