- **State Management**: Installed and configured Pinia for global state management.
- **Connection Management**: Implemented the basic  component and wired it to the  store for database connection functionality.
- **Database Explorer**: Implemented a lazy-loading database explorer () using  (built with Vuetify  and ). The  store now handles dynamic fetching of database objects.
- **Query Workspace**: Integrated  for the SQL editor and scaffolded the  and  components for a tabbed query interface with initial result display capabilities.
